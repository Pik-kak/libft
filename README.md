****Libft - My very first own library****
---
Summary:
This is a 42 shcool project. It is about coding a C library that will contain a lot of general purpose functions.


Technical considerations
1. Declaring global variables is forbidden.
2. You must write your own functions without using any external functions unless stated otherwise.
---
**Parts**
1. Part 1, you must write your own functions implementing the original ones. Functions are: isalpha, isdigit, isalnum, isascii, isprint, strlen, memset, bzero, memcpy, memmove, strlcpy, strlcat, toupper, tolower, strchr, strrchr, strncmp, memchr, memcmp, strnstr, atoi. In calloc and strdup you are allowed to use malloc();
5. Part 2, you must develop a set of functions that are either not in the libc, or that are part of it but in a different form. Functions are: ft_substr, ft_strjoin, ft_strtrim, ft_split, ft_itoa, ft_strmapi, ft_striteri, ft_putchar_fd, ft_putstr_fd, ft_putendl_fd, ft_putnbr_fd
6. Bonus part, functions for manipulating lists. Functions are: ft_lstnew ft_lstadd_front, ft_lstsize, ft_lstlast, ft_lstadd_back, ft_lstdelone, ft_lstclear, ft_lstiter, ft_lstmap
