****Libft - My very first own library****
---
Summary:
This is a 42 school project. It is about coding a C library that will contain a lot of general purpose functions.


Technical considerations
1. Declaring global variables is forbidden.
2. You must write your own functions without using any external functions unless stated otherwise.
---
**Parts**
1. Part 1, you must write your own functions implementing the original ones. In calloc and strdup you are allowed to use malloc();
2. Part 2, you must develop a set of functions that are either not in the libc, or that are part of it but in a different form.
6. Bonus part, functions for manipulating lists.
